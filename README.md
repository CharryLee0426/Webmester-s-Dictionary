* Find the best app icon relevant the dictionary app in [https://macosicons.com/](https://macosicons.com/);
* Download that app icon;
* Open finder, then go to the Application folder, find the dictionary app;
* Right click(Double-finger click) and go into the "get info" page;
* Drag the app icon to the location of default app icon (upper-left corner), you can see a little plus;
* Boom! Your app icon has changed!
